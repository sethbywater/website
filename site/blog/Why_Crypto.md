# Why Cryptocurrency?

16 September 2021

Cryptocurrency takes its name from it usefulness as a medium of payment. However, in practice, it is clumsy to use and widely misunderstood. Even when the underlying technology is explained the practical advantages are often ambiguous. Understanding the problem that cryptocurrency attempts to solve is fundamental to any analysis of it. Before I can devote any more time to research, I must understand the motivating cause.

Many superficial claims made by cryptocurrency promoters can easily be debunked. Although the speed of these networks is highly touted, in reality blockchain is much slower than any centralized payment system like PayPal or Visa. The same goes for store of value; while it is true that Bitcoin cannot be physically destroyed or stolen, the characteristics of storage capacity of mediums of exchange have more to do with their stable value relative to other products. 

There are three things necessary to define something as a currency: being a means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account. When these criteria are applied to Bitcoin and others, it is found that cryptocurrency fails on all three counts (BIS).

Cryptocurrency is not intended to be faster or more convenient than traditional forms of payment, though this is a goal of the developers working on it. What Satoshi Nakamoto and others sought to do was create a system in which it is possible to do things which would be impossible in conventional systems. In Nakamoto's own words:

> Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. 


He/she/they make a few points here. First, they bring up non-reversible payments. Right now, the only way to make a major purchase like a car or house requires cash or a bank statement. With a distributed ledger in which it is indisputable how much money someone has, even the most major financial purchases could be digital. Payment is always guaranteed with blockchain.

This has implications outside of mortgages. As our society becomes more connected and payments are deferred to devices instead of cash, the guarantee of an absence of fraud becomes not only a nice-to-have, but a requirement.

This is especially important in areas where currency distibution is difficult or impossible. In rural countries, there is a large overhead in setting up banks through which people can deposit and withdraw money. In Nicaragua, for example, 19% of people have a formal bank account, but only 8% are able to borrow and 14% actually have formal savings. In the same country, 93% of people have an mobile phone (Tapscott 170). In these situations, the transition to digital money is inevitable, and it is necessary to ensure security in these systems.

The underlying philosophy of immutability is not limited to cryptocurrency. Any information that can be recorded digitally could theoretically be stored on a blockchain, specifically a record of its ownership. This is an archivist's dream. All public records can be stored on free, available networks. Just like how digital currency removes the overhead of brick-and-mortar banks, this can remove the difficulty in providing individual services to citizens, like health records and passports. In a world where 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 do not officially exist ("Birth Registration"), this could be a godsend. This is already being attempted in Ethipoia (Petrik).

One last point is that decentralized means of payment, or any record for that matter, are not necessarily anti-government. It is possible for central authorities like governments and banks to offer currency and exercise monetary policy while still having absolutely no control over its usage. This distinction is important, as the possibility of a state-issued Digital Fiat Currency (DFC) has been discussed (Kirkby).
