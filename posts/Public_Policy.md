# Public Policy and Crypto

_October 14 2021_

---

## Breakdown

Here is the current state of public policy on cryptocurrency:

Since [IRS Notice 2014-21](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7FhSemtQvq4P4yS7sJCKMj/a98939d651d7ee24a56a897e2d37ef30/coinbase-digital-asset-policy-proposal.pdf), cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes, not a currency, and is thus subject to capital gains tax.[1] Cryptocurrency exchanges must also register and get a license before operating, promising to practice proper KYC.

_Note: This is a very US-centric reflection. I am not ignoring the importance of other countries, but most blockchain projects are US-based, and thus US-regulated. For full disclosure, I am American._

This is practically where regulation on cryptocurrency ends. In regards to exchanges, platforms on which one may trade fiat for crypto and vice versa, the usual anti-money laundering (AML) and market manipulation rules apply. However, many of these rules were established several decades ago with the intent of increasing information about financial assets, like stocks, so that investors could accurately gauge the risk of their holdings. Some of these rules precede the internet, and are unsuited to handling digital assets appropriately.

The US government is clearly not oblivious to the issue. At one point, there was a [bounty](https://sam.gov/opp/3b7875d5236b47f6a77f64c19251af60/view?index=opp) put out by the IRS for a way to de-anonymize the hyper-secret [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) blockchain. There is an ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and [Ripple](https://ripple.com/), a company whose main product is a cryptocurrency, the outcome of which would set a precedent for the legal status of digital assets.

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the US, recently released a [Digital Asset Policy Proposal](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7FhSemtQvq4P4yS7sJCKMj/a98939d651d7ee24a56a897e2d37ef30/coinbase-digital-asset-policy-proposal.pdf), which we will come back to later. Also, Gary Gensler, an economist famous for his ["Blockchain and Money"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) course at MIT, was appointed as the SEC Chair in February 2021.

There are areas of concern which the US government has not yet or not adequately addressed in regards to digital currency:
- The duty the government has to protect consumers
- The extent to which things are legally binding in a cryptocurrency context
- Money supply

## Consumer Protection

This is the area which the US government has attempted to regulate the most. The Ripple lawsuit is over the status of Ripple's token as a security or a commodity. This is a big deal, because securities have tighter restrictions around their issuance and trading.

With the flood of ICOs currently being offered on Ethereum and other networks, this is perhaps the most urgent. It is not uncommon for groups to issue a crypto-token and put great effort into marketing it, only to abandon it once they make money.

Influencers on social media are free to offer financial advice. It is very common for them to buy a certain asset, promote it online, and then sell it once it gains popularity. This is technically legal with stocks, but is frowned upon. However, younger people who lack financial experience are fresh targets for this manipulation. To prevent this, and because financial advice from social media teaches bad habits, TikTok has [banned financial advice](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-bans-influencers-promoting-cryptocurrencies-194500204.html) on its platform.

There are methods established to prevent this behavior in regards to securities, but further actions need to be taken to apply them to exchanges.

## Legal Bindings

The latest in blockchain technology is smart contracts. These are transactions that occur based on a set of predefined conditions and execute automatically. These have huge potential for streamlining the economy by removing middlemen--i.e. lawyers--and thus reducing the costs and increasing the speed of business. However, there is a question that is not only unanswered, but has largely been unasked: are smart contracts legally binding?

This is part of a larger issue about the flexibility of smart contracts. Whereas the modern court system is able to handle all cases, and can nullify contracts or waive sentences where it is deemed appropriate, computers--especially decentralized networks--will execute each transaction and contract regardless of the circumstances.

So, are smart contracts legally binding. This question cannot be answered until we establish how we would go about enforcing smart contracts which have real-world implications. If one person mortgages their house on the blockchain, and are later evicted, who is to perform the eviction? If these transactions are not under the jurisdiction of the government, they are not legally binding and the police cannot intervene.

What if a smart contract is technically satisfied, but one party did not uphold implicit business rules, and effectively cheated the contract on a technicality? In the real world, technicalities can be taken to court and reversed. Computers, on the other hand, do not care and will execute the contract with finality.

So far, cryptographic networks have failed to implement accommodations for edge cases where flexibility and arbitration are necessary.

I apologize for raising a lot of questions here, and not offering answers. I plan on focusing on this in my final paper.

## Money supply

Even before the issue of digital currency, the Federal Reserve's behavior regarding the money supply has been controversial. Interest rates have remained arbitrarily low for a long time, and the Fed has given little indication about changing.

Bitcoin was the start of a rise of Neo-Austrian economics, which hold the stance that governments should not issue national currencies and all money should come from private banks. This movement is larger than monetary policy and is more about being against any large entity with control. [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/) is another embodiment of anti-establishment values.

Whether or not central banks should have a monopoly over the money supply is an old argument, but it is a widely held belief that it is necessary for the government to have at least some influence over the economy--market discipline is not effective in maintaining economic stability.

I personally believe Post-Kenysian economics are the most realistic perspective, and the only model capable of melding digital and fiat economies. This economic model assumes that "full information is...an idealistic fiction...[and] financial instability is the norm rather than the exception" (Dow 157).

This approach supports a relationship between the private and the public sector, a social contract. One where "central banks stand ready to supply liquidity to the [private] banks [in times of instability]. In return, the banks accept closer, costlier regulation than the rest of the financial sector" (Dow 158).

Where cryptocurrency fits in this model is not clear, admittedly. Are the maintainers of the Bitcoin codebase being regulated, or the exchanges, or the users? In any case, the point of the government is to "aim to increase efficiency of markets _with respect to social goals,_ even if it reduces profitability" (Dow 158).

## Other notes

It is not necessarily bad that there has been little moves by the US government so far. Any legislation has the very real potential to stay in effect for many decades. Because of this, it is better to not pass legislation than to pass bad or rushed, uninformed legislation.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve has been notably conservative since the recovery from the 2008 crisis. Interest rates show no sign of going back to normal levels, and the Fed is more concerned with creating an environment to nuture a stock market than it is to prepare for another financial crisis. In other words, they will not touch the economy if it is doing well, and are very hesitant to introduce any change, let alone tighter regulation. Many of these blockchain projects and exchanges are US-based, and thus bring in significant revenue.

Two topics I did not cover here are the regulation of the nature of blockchain projects. This includes the discussion of where open-source fits in the modern economy, and the relationship the public has and historically has had with open-source software. The other is privacy, which is a topic in and of itself.

Coinbase has made a [statement](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7FhSemtQvq4P4yS7sJCKMj/a98939d651d7ee24a56a897e2d37ef30/coinbase-digital-asset-policy-proposal.pdf) encouraging advancements in public policy.[2] According to the exchange, proper regulatory action would have four pillars:

> - Regulate digital assets under a separate framework
> - Designate one regulator for digital asset markets
> - Protect and empower holders of digital assets
> - Promote interoperability and fair competition

The first two pillars are reasonable given the fundamental differences between crypto and fiat money. The third deals addresses concerns about market manipulation and fraud, and is intended to increase market resiliency. The fourth pillar is slightly unclear; it is not specified whether Coinbase is calling for fair competition between separate blockchain projects, or between crypto and fiat money.

Coinbase's suggestions are fairly practical, and they also provide some specific examples of areas in which revamped regulation could be beneficial for everyone. I encourage any reading to also read Coinbase's proposal.
