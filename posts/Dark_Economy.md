# The Dark Economy and Cryptomarkets

## Cryptomarkets

A group of Canadian researchers use the term 'cryptomarkets' - "a type of website that employs advanced encryption to protect users' anonymity" that is practically always used for illicit markets (Broséus). This was a part of their study of eight cryptomarkets used for selling illegal drugs, which concluded that the market was thriving.

Such websites use [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) cryptography, [TOR browsing](https://www.torproject.org/), and cryptocurrency to ensure the security and anonymity of its users. Any one of these methods could be used create a private service, but the combination provides unparalleled secrecy.

One such cryptomarket was the notorious Silk Road - a marketplace for drugs, traffiking, and hitmen (Adler). The saga of the Silk Road is a dramatic one, but it proves the potential for a network of illegal activity based upon public cryptography systems, especially cryptography

Cryptocurrency is undeniably used for illegal activity. It does not, however, fundamentally change the behavior of criminals or the nature of the crime. Anonymity and secrecy are better accomplished through other cryptographic means, but Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies streamline the process by making payments anonymous. There is nothing implicitly illegal about Bitcoin, but that does not excuse it from criticism. 

Our energy should not be spent on debating the role of Bitcoin in illegal markets. It is crucial, but not necessarily at fault. Instead, attention should be focused on advanced ways of enforcing regulation that, currently, is easy to sidestep via the blockchain.

The group of Canadian researchers conclude their study by calling for better "intervention policies against anonymous marketplaces. Indeed, the actual strategy – both expensive and time and resources consuming – that consists
in taking down cryptomarkets does not seem to be efficient to
disrupt trafficking on Dark Net markets." They go on to argue that, in order to enforce laws in cryptomarkets, better analytical tools are needed that can be applied to both the blockchain and services which use cryptocurrency (Broséus).

## Money laundering

Money laundering is a process that time has grown efficient over time. The art market is the chosen medium for the practice. As a convicted conspirator was recorded saying, "the art trade is the only market that is unregulated... [a client] could even buy the art under a false name" (Mashberg).

The fine art market has zero Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements that are enforced in other markets; dealers do not have to report large transactions, they may keep their clients anonymous, and they do not have to file 'suspicious activities reports' with the US Treasury Department if they doubt the origin of the money they are paid with. Banks, insurance companies, casinos, etc. all must do this (Mashberg).

Lack of regulation, anonymity... sound familiar? The recent rise of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) has become a new way to legitimize money more efficiently.

The process of money laundering is this: a person or group with dirty money will use it to buy an expensive piece of art under a false name, or no name. The dealer doesn't actually have to hand over the art. This is because, after the money has 'cooled off,' the people who bought the art will sell it back at a slightly lower price under a different name. They now have money from a verifiable source, and the dealer gets to keep a small cut.

NFTs allow those with dirty money to cut out any dealer or physical art in this process. The cryptocurrency they received from illicit transactions can be used to buy the rights to an NFT. Afterwards, they sell the NFT to themselves for a much higher price, under the alias of a separate account. Voila, their cryptocurrency has a verifiable paper trail.

There was a bill to introduce tighter regulations on art and antique trading in Congress, but it was [deferred to a committee in 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5886/text) and has been stagnant since. If the government and law enforcement is to catch up with modern forms of money laundering, it first needs to deal with the conventional methods.

## Accountability

In setting out this week to extend my research, I wanted to group together crime and privacy in regards to blockchain. This is because of the larger debate of safety vs. privacy - many methods we use to catch criminals involve invading the privacy of innocent citizens.

The main argument for transparency associated with blockchain is accountability. In the words of the authors of _Blockchain Revolution_:

> "In our view, companies that conduct some or all of their transactions on the blockchain will enjoy a trust bump in share price. Shareholders and citizens will come to expect all publicly traded firms and taxpayer-funded organizations to run their treasuries, at minimum, on the blockchain. Because of increased transparency, investors will be able to see whether a CEO really deserved that fat bonus. Smart contracts enabled by blockchains, will require counterparties to abide by their commitments and voters will be able to see whether their representatives are being honest or acting with fiscal integrity." (Tapscott 11)

This does have an air of Utopian hopes, but it is not unfeasible. The absence of transparency is one of the biggest modern issues. Not only will powerful individuals be held accountable for proper business and political practices, but we may be able to use the paper trail of the blockchain to develop better methods for eliminating criminal activity, just as criminals have used it to exploit the current limitations of law enforcement.

However, totally indisputable records are not always desirable; they do not fit the human tendency to forgive and forget.

If we try to record everything on a blockchain "we lose not only the nuance of social interaction but also the gift of forgetting. People ought never to be defined by their worst day" (Tapscott 16). I went into more detail on this last week, but accountability can sometimes be detrimental, especially when exposing someone's past criminal or financial record.
