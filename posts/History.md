# History of blockchain & cryptocurrency
_September 21, 2021_

---

Cryptocurrency has been a topic of increasing interest recently. However, it can be easy to feel as though there is too much information for the common person to understand. One solution is to learn the history of blockchain and other related technologies; the best way to understand a new technology is to understand the problem which it was developed to solve.

This is one of many topics which are very difficult to rationalize about because of its potential to change individuals' lives through monetary returns. Therfore, the perspective which can be gained by learning the history of the field is another advantage to doing so.

Chronological order is the simplest way to zoom out and see the larger picture of the history that precipitated Bitcoin and created billionaires.

## 1991: Timestamps
Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta outline the origional design of blockchain.[^1] It was originally intended to timestamp digital documents so that they could not be backdated or tampered with.

## 1992: Proof of work
Cynthia Dwork creates the first proof-of-work system, initially intended to combat junk mail.[^2] The "mining" incurs a cost on the sender in the form of time and the cost of electricity.

The major difference between Dwork's proposal and modern proof-of-work is that Dwork wanted a central authority to decide the price per email, which meant that the system gained little adoption.

## 1997: God Protocol
Nick Szabo publishes _The God Protocol_,[^3] a short paper which outlines the ideal internet protocol, a system in which all information is sent through God who is able to verify the identity and autenticity of every person and peice of data on the internet, making scamming, stealing, and other maliciousness impossible. Although this is impossible, Szabo points out that we act like it exists. Every time we transact on the internet or interact with a third party, we take a leap of faith and hope that they will protect our identity and data. We treat them as deites.

In this paper he coins the term "smart contracts" and proposes that, with modern cryptographic methods, any agreement that can be negotiated through a third party can be conducted directly, person to person, more safely.

## 1997: HashCash
A cryptocurrency called HashCash is first proposed. It was meant to be a deterrent against denial-of-service attacks, which involve overloading a system with spam, instead of a replacement for hard money. Like Dwork's idea, it functions by attaching a time and monetary (in the form of electricity) cost to communication.[^4]

## 1998: B-Money
Wei Dai, a researcher at Microsoft, created B-Money, which used a blockchain ledger and proof-of-work, where the value of any B-Money was the cost of completing the computation required to produce it.[^5]

Unlike Dwork's system, the price per computation is decided based on the free market. A notable mark of Dai's work is that the result of mining computations _must have no intellectual or physical value,_ otherwise it will be produced anyway and the currency will be a free by-product.

However, Dai's system still relies on a central authority to verify transactions, which failed to attract usage.

## 2001: BitTorrent
Bram Cohen creates BitTorrent, a decentralized open-source system which allowed users to split encrypted files into chunks to be spread among a network of people called "seeds," which could be retrieved later. This is still a popular way of securely downloading and sharnig files.

BitTorrent offers rewards in the form of "ratio points" to users who contribute to the network. BitTorrent would be a major inspiration for Bitcoin. The problem with BitTorrent is that the points it offered were hard to verify, and could be essentially counterfeited.

## 2008: Bitcoin
Satoshi Nakamoto publishes _Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system_.[^14] The system proposed by the anonymous person or group becomes operational in 2009, and the Bitcoin blockchain begins.

Nakamoto was inspired by BitTorrent to create a way to make transaction verifiable without a central authority and without being spoofable.


## 2013: Ethereum
Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, starts developing another blockchain-based platform which allows for "smart contracts." The project is called Ethereum[^7] and goes live in July 2015.

The smart contracts which Ethereum drives extend the idea of trustless transactions: not only is the need for a transactional intermediary removed, but so is the need for intermediaries to create and execute contracts and agreements.

Ethereum becomes widely used by crypto-startups due to its ability to host other cryptocurrencies, called "tokens" on its own blockchain.

## 2013: Dogecoin
Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus create Dogecoin, an adaptation of another blockchain's cosebase which was meant to appeal to a wider audience than Bitcoin, which was the only effective digital currency at the time. At heart, the project was a joke; there is no limit on the creation of new coins, and the branding is covered in memes of the famous Shiba Inu.

Although the creators expected only mild interest, Dogecoin became extremely popular as a way to tip other people online, particularly Reddit. Users also participated in several crowdfunding projects, like donating $30,000 to Jamaica's Olympic bobsled team. Dogecoin's lighthearted spirit became its greatest strength.

## 2014: Mt. Gox
The webiste mtgox.com, origionally a trading card webiste (Magic: the Gathering Online eXchange) was purchased by Jed McCaleb, under whom it changed into a Bitcoin exchange and was renamed Mt. Gox. The platform was later sold to Mark Karpeles. in 2011, there was a security breach in which a hacker transfered Bitcoin from the exchange to himself. In the following months, more Bitcoin was sent to invalid addresses, rendering them useless.[^9]

The exchange continued, and by 2013 Mt. Gox processed about 70% of all Bitcoin transactions.[^10] However, after some complaints about missing withdrawals, Mt. Gox suddenly decided to halt all withdrawals from the platform. It later came out that some users had discovered a vulnerability in the protocol and had used it to duplicate withdrawals, slowly draining 750,000 Bitcoins form the system. The price of Bitcoin plummeted, and the exchange files for bankruptcy in 2014.

## 2016: Ethereum hack and fork
The Ethereum Network allows for systems called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These are a essentially a form of crowdfunding in which donators have a say in the function of the organization. One such DAO became extremely popular. However, it was discovered that the smart contract -- the code which determines the function of the DAO -- contained a bug. On June 18, more than 3.6m ether was drained from the DAO.[^15]

This was not a flaw in the Ethereum protocol, only the particular smart contract. However, many people lost faith in the future of the system. 

One of the major selling points of blockchain is its immutability. However, participants may choose at any time to stop following the rest of the chain. This was the solution to the hack: instead of using the most recent block as the head of the blockchain, go back in the chain to a time before the DAO existed, and start adding blocks at that point. This creates a fork: there now exists two forms of this blokchain, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the former being the one supported by the Ethereum team.

## 2017: Project Jasper
Bank of Canada begins Project Jasper, an experiment to explore how blockchain could function in practical enviroments. The project has some positive findings but ultimately decides that blockchain offers no real benefit over a centralized payment system.[^8]

## 2017: Proof of stake
Buterin announces that Ethereum will shift towards proof of stake for mining, leaving behind proof of work.


## 2017: ICO Bubble
In late 2017, the price of many cryptocurrencies incereased by orders of magnitude.[^11] This was fueled by Binance, a new exchange which promised to offer services for an cryptocurrency which met their loose criteria. This allowed pracatically anyone to create a cryptocurrency, and many did, often accompanied by promises which were difficult to keep. Many of these "coins" were created on the Ethereum blockchain, and their initial offerings were called Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs.

When it became clear that the technology had become somewhat overstated in the heat, prices of cryptocurrencies fell once again. The causes of this boom and crash are the subject of much study in both economic and social contexts.[^12]

## 2021: Reddit stocks
Reddit users in the subreddit /r/WallStreetBets planned a major buying event on Gamestop and AMC Theaters stocks. This was an attempt to attack major financial institutions who had shorted these stocks by more than their actual worth. The entire saga prompted many people with little previous investing experience to enter the market, and many of these people also became interested in cryptocurrency as another lucrative oppurtunity.

One coin which multiplied in value as a result was Dogecoin, the currency meant to satirize the technology.[^13] Celebrities, notably Elon Musk, voiced their love for Dogecoin, which prompted mild hysteria. The rise in speculation in cryptoassets has sparked debate about whether its price has become detached from its actual value and if its greatest value is its potential profits. This rise in prices continues today.

## 2021: Legal Tender
On June 8, 2021, the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, tweeted a bill that he had sent to Congress recommending Bitcoin be instated as a national currency.[^16] This came after hyperinflation in the country and much of Central America grew unmanagable. The goal was to stabilize the national dollar, but this only drew criticism about Bitcoin's volatile price. There were protests in the country following the approval of the bill.

## 2021 - Present: Another rise
The recent prices of cryptocurrencies are multiples higher than the previous all-time-highs in 2017, and ICOs are even more common. Major financial institutions are also becoming invested. 

It remains to be seen how the technology will stand up to the extreme speculation: the price of cryptocurrency is clearly no longer tied to a commodity as Wei Dai proposed, and it is not tied to a protocol like HashCash. The question that remain is whether the prices of cryptocurrencies are increasing due to their utility or their speculative value.

## Lessons

The history of blockchain and proof-of-work is a relatively short one, as the rate at which modern technologies advance is always increasing. However, the density of events makes it unapproachable to newcomers. This may push those who are new to technology or finance toward uninformed, but accessible, sources. The social media app TikTok had to ban users from offering finanical advice.

One thing missing from this timeline is legislation: there have been no major events, besides in El Salvador, that indicate the future relationship between hard, nationally backed cash and digital assets. This will be a focus of my further research.
