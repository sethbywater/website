# The point of this website
*July 11 2021*

If you have come across this post because it was the first one listed under 'Recently
Posted', you are very early to the party.

As I am writing this, there is almost nothing on this website, which is fine by me.
Most of the work I have been putting into it so far has been on the server
functionality and the process of building webpages from standard Markdown files (like
the one I'm writing now). This may seem like a simple task, and for more experienced
programmers it may be, but for me it was a lot of work. I had a lot of fun, but that
doesn't mean it wasn't work.

But for what? The code I wrote has been implemented several times over (Jekyll, Hugo, 
etc) with more flexibility and functionality than this. The reasons are few and
self-explanatory:

## I like coding but I'm on summer break and need something to code
My journey to falling in love with programming has been a long time coming, but over 
the past year it's come to a head.

My dad is a web developer and tried to get me into Python early, but I didn't feel any
real attraction. Later on I tried going back but didn't like Python, so I tried C++.
Now I wanted to learn more. Somehow the name Rust came across my reddit homepage and I
clicked, and then it was all over.

## I need practical code to show future employers
I'm in the same boat as many other soon-to-be graduates. This is an easy piece to show
off and prove that, at the very least, I can learn new things. It even works on people
in industries that don't involve much programming, because you don't need a Github
account to visit [sethbywater.com](sethbywater.com).

Besides, if we're being honest, search engine optimization is as much a thing on
LinkedIn as it is on Google. Now, I don't think we should spend time chasing down
buzzwords, but it doesn't hurt to have systems programming on your resume.

## I like to learn
This may be a story I tell myself to hide the truth that I actually just like to make
things hard for myself, but I think it's true either way.

I'm a student of Mechatronics Techology at SUNY Delhi. I like this field, and it
requires an intimate knowledge of electricity as a fundamental force of nature. But it
doesn't really scratch the coding itch. I program PLCs, but I consider that a different
skill.

Mechatronics and web development are two ends of a spectrum, and it's debatable whether
or not it's even the same spectrum. But that doesn't mean there aren't transferable
skills. Troubleshooting is a life skill.

At the point I'm writing, I don't think I'll be a web developer, but I think I'll be
a better engineer having tried it. There's a lot of really neat things to do in this
world and the only way to fully appreciate them is to try them out.
