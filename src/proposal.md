# Cryptocurrecny Independant Study Proposal

As part of my membership in the honor's program an SUNY Delhi, I may complete an independent study to fulfill an honor's credit. For the fall 2021 semester, I chose to study cryptocurrency.

The following is the proposal I submitted to the honor's board as a proposal for my independent study.

## *Project:*

*Clearly define your topic and nature of your study. Give a detailed description of the study/project including approximate hours to be worked weekly, and the nature of the finished project. What will the student be doing that is substantially different from another course in the catalog?*

Cryptocurrency is undeniably a topic of interest in today’s world. Although it has the attention of many as a speculative venture, the potential benefits and consequences of its adoption are still widely misunderstood.

The purpose of this independent study is to examine the use cases of cryptocurrency and its economic, legal, and political repercussions. There will be a focus on learning the technology which makes these systems feasible, but most of the research will pursue an analytical comparison between current economic conventions and the monetary and informational systems which the creators of cryptographic networks would have the world adopt.

Other courses at Delhi provide a basic micro-or macro-economic overview, but none require such a intermingling of technology, research, and sociology.

## *Goals:*

*What do you hope to accomplish? What are your objectives?*

Cryptocurrency has garnered the attention of both academic and financial institutions and the most common public, gaining a status as a technological game-changer as well as a lucrative investment opportunity. It has also been the subject of an equally large amount of criticism, for many of the same reasons it is praised. 

I will analyze the positive and negative arguments on each of these fronts. By the end of this project, I would like to fully understand the future of cryptocurrency beyond its novelty as it relates to changes in social, economic, and political convention. I will focus on cryptocurrency’s history as an investment asset and its potential niche as a currency or an economic tool, and the fallacies which may prevent its adoption beyond the pigeonhole it currently occupies.

By the end of this project, I would like to have an understanding of the future of cryptocurrency beyond its novelty as it relates to changes in social, economic, and political convention.

## *Methods:*

*How will you conduct your research (surveys, lab experiments, library reseach, readings, etc)?*

Research will be conducted mostly through analysis of existing literature on the topic. This will include peer-reviewed academic sources, newspaper and journal articles, interviews with prominent figures in relevant fields, and a series of lectures available through MIT OpenCourseWare. The technical analysis and comparison of various cryptographic protocols will reference the official white paper of the respective system or organization. Research will be conducted mostly through analysis of existing literature on the topic.

## *Detailed statement of methods of assesment that will be used:*

*How will work be presented for grading? Examples of acceptable methods are: presentaion of findings to a class, authored article, paper, exhibit, etc.*

I will meet with my sponsor for this independent study, Dr. Hamblin, on a weekly or biweekly schedule to discuss my research progress and my journal entry for that week. The research paper will be presented to other students and professors, and will also be displayed at the Student Activities Fair.

*Discuss how the assessment outcomes will be met:*

My research paper will be submitted for grading and my presentation will also be reviewed. Intermediate steps, such as a topic proposal and outline, will be submitted to show advancement in the project.

## *Duties and obligations to be met by the student:*

*Please include a detailed timeline of the project. This should be a list of assignments, meetings with faculty, etc. Please include deadlines.*

The focus of research of every week will be, preliminarily:
1. History of cryptocurrency
2. Attacks of cryptocurrency networks
3. Energy usage of hash mining
4. Cryptocurrency in dark economies
5. Comparing cryptocurrency boom to other speculative booms
6. Historic government managment of currency and proposed cryptocurrency management
7. Public policy and social relations
8. Introduction of credit to unbanked populations
9. Update on research paper progress
10. Public privacy
11. Taxes and laws of cryptocurrency
12. Public records and blockchain
13. Possibility of government-maintained
14. Presentation
15. Review of presentation, paper, and independent study
